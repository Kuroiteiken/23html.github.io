## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `AGENTS.md` as the single canonical project reference for all agents.
- Added Turkish translations for the README, agent instructions, and repository
  changelog as `.TR.md` files.
- Added Prettier, Stylelint, and ESLint for source formatting and validation.
- Added an automated GitHub Pages build, validation, and deployment workflow.
- Added a build step that prepares deployable static files under `dist/`.

### Changed

- Split the monolithic `index.html` into CSS, functional JavaScript sources, and
  a small HTML entry point.
- Grouped JavaScript sources under `core`, `data`, `systems`, `ui`, `utils`, and
  `world` responsibilities.
- Formatted legacy CSS and fixed invalid measurements, typos, and non-standard
  declarations.
- Updated JavaScript and CSS with behavior-preserving modern syntax.

### Fixed

- Preserved legacy global function-hoisting behavior by generating a single
  browser bundle from the separated sources.
- Prevented development dependencies from being included in the GitHub Pages
  artifact.
